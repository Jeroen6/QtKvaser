# QtKvaser
This is a small demo application for a Kvaser CAN Leaf Light V2.
Although the driver should work on more Kvaser hardware.

## How it works
This small demo app was made in a single evening based on a previously failed attempt using a different brand interface.
You can connect and go on bus. Receive all messages, and transmit some using the input field.

## Binaries
Prepared binaries for Windows, including Qt and kvaser dll's are available in the bin folder.
